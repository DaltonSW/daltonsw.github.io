## Welcome! 

Stylish is a simple and intuitive way to create and apply stylish config files   
Works with `ls`, `tree`, `fd`, `exa`, and anything else that respects `$LS_COLORS`  

- NO file editing!
- NO dealing with encoding strings!
- NO manual mapping of hex codes to 8-bit colors!
- NO blindly working without an actual preview!
- NO need to hunt down scattered, poor documentation and references!

Are you ready to feel stylish?

## Quick Start

If you are comfortable with the defaults and just want to fast track your way to a pretty terminal, then you're just 2 steps away.
- Install via one of the methods below
- Add the following to your shell's init script:
```sh
eval $(stylish apply default)
alias ls=ls --color=auto
```

Every shell launch going forward will be styled with the default. Enjoy!

## Usage

- Start the program with `stylish`. This will:
    - Create a `stylish` directory in your user's default config directory (typically `~/.config`)
    - Create a `default` theme inside of that directory. **Note:** This theme is intended to be used on a dark background
- With the program running, you're able to create and edit your themes to your heart's content
- Once you're ready to apply a theme, you'll need to add the following to your shell's init file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.):
    - **Required:** `eval $(stylish apply <theme>)`
    - *Recommended:* `alias ls=ls --color=auto`
- Once your init file is edited, relaunch your shell to start seeing the updated colors.

## Command Reference

### `stylish`

*Launch the TUI*

- If you run the program without any subcommands, it will launch you directly into the editor TUI

### `stylish apply [theme]`

*This command turns the theme's YAML files into the final environment variable expected format*

- Converts the given theme's YAML definition files into a `dircolors` compatible file
- Saves the `.dircolors` file in the root of the theme's directory
- Runs `dircolors` on the generated file to get the appropriate `LS_COLORS` string
- Returns a command that's ready to be `eval`'d to automatically export the `LS_COLORS` string to the environment variable

### `stylish example [theme]`

*This command is to make setting up directories for example screenshots significantly easier and quicker*

> [ALERT]
> This command requires the `tree` command to be installed

- Creates an `example` directory located in your theme's root
- For each style in your theme, a new directory is created matching the style's name
- For each filetype associated with the theme (up to 4), a random filename is generated and a blank file is created with that name and filetype
