## About Me

I grew up in Texas and got my BS in Software Engineering from UT Dallas. I moved to Wisconsin after graduating, where I currently live and work full time as a software developer.  
  
I spend my free time playing (and making) video games, working on projects, and learning about various bits of nothingness. I'm a big fan of dogs, though cats are ok too (don't tell mine I said that). I'll be talking about some of that stuff on here.

Welcome to my little slice of the internet. Hope you enjoy your stay. :)
