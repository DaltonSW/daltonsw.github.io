This site has been quite the work in progress over the past few years. I grabbed the domain in ~2021 to use as an email redirect, because I wanted to have a unique and simple email to be able to put on a resume. 

Eventually, I decided to actually do something with the site. I wanted to at least have it be a place I could tell people to type into a browser and get SOMETHING to show up. The main problem there is that I absolutely **hate** front end development. HTML looks gross, CSS is hell in a handbasket, and JavaScript is a scourge on the world.
